## Today's class
0. Finish nb1mine.ipynb (where you were working on getting your own image recognizer working)
    * finish means that you also *cleaned* your data!!
    * record whether or not cleaning improved the results and by how much
[Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
1. In nb1mine.ipynb, write a function that approximates the area under the curve $f(x)=x^2$ between $x=0$ and $x=\mathtt{right}$ where `right` is an argument of the function.
    * Use a slicing/rectangle style approach
    * Use [this page](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/python/) as a resource to refresh your memory of how programming in python works
    * If you can't write the python code, at least try to write **pseudocode** (code where we don't care about syntax errors)
2. Any combination of the following:
    * Try another variation of an image recognizer and/or test out your image recognizer with more pictures
    * Calculate the volume of a torus
    * Improve our area calculating function to be more flexible (maybe it accepts a function as an argument as well as a left and right endpoint)
    * Find and understand an article/video about AI and email me high-level notes on the topic (a 1 page article might turn into 3 or 4 bullets)

## Using Colab Reminders:
* Colab does ***NOT*** autosave!!!
* Cmd+O -> Github tab
* Look for the right repository in the `Repository` dropdown. If it's not there, put Viewpoint-School-Computer-Science in the `Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user` search box and try again
* ***MAKE SURE*** we're using GPU
    - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> Select GPU
* Always run the first few cells
* Save work whenever you've finished a meaningful "chunk" of work and definitely at the end of class
    - File -> Save a copy in Github.
    - Look at the Repository dropdown and make sure it's the right name, fixing if not
    - ***CHANGE*** the commit message to something meaningful that captures what has happened in the file since the last save
    - Make sure the `Include a link to Colaboratory` checkbox is checked
    - Hit `OK`
