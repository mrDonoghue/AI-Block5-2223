## Today's class
* Open nb2 in [colab](https://colab.research.google.com)
* run first 2 code cells (the imports)
* Gradient descent example
    ```
    heights = tensor([16., 20., 22., 24., 40., 52., 53., 56., 63., 82.])
    flowers = tensor([2., 2., 3., 2., 4., 5., 6., 5., 6., 8.])
    ```
* Gradient descent new example:
    ```
    x=tensor([35., 42., 43., 54., 59., 64., 76., 78., 82., 98.])
    y=tensor([52., 55., 54., 52., 52., 47., 47., 43., 45., 40.])
    ```


## Using Colab Reminders:
* Colab does ***NOT*** autosave!!!
* Cmd+O -> Github tab
* Look for the right repository in the `Repository` dropdown. If it's not there, put Viewpoint-School-Computer-Science in the `Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user` search box and try again
* ***MAKE SURE*** we're using GPU
    - Runtime -> Change Runtime Type -> Select GPU
* Always run the first few cells
* Save work whenever you've finished a meaningful "chunk" of work and definitely at the end of class
    - File -> Save a copy in Github.
    - Look at the Repository dropdown and make sure it's the right name, fixing if not
    - ***CHANGE*** the commit message to something meaningful that captures what has happened in the file since the last save
    - Make sure the `Include a link to Colaboratory` checkbox is checked
    - Hit `OK`
