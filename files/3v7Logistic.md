# 3v7Logistic Lab
Your task: Adapt the given code code to build a logistic regression classifier for 3 vs 7 in the MNIST dataset


# Steps
* [colab](colab.research.google.com)
* Open nb2
* Open *new notebook*
  * Name the new notebook `yourname3v7logistic.ipynb` (replacing `yourname` with something that will let me know it's you)
  * ***Share the notebook with me!!***
* From nb2 steal all of the code for downloading and torchify-ing the MNIST data. Put this into the new notebook
* Clean up the stolen code and get rid of any unnecessary garbage
* Start stealing code from [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hjIZDP0Amv48-ZwLeL_ClH2pJ30l8sDJ?usp=sharing) *one cell at a time*
  * You *will* need to adapt a lot of the cells.
  *  For each cell, think about its purpose, whether we need it at all and whether we need to adapt it
