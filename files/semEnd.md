## Reflection
For each of the following subsections, carry out a short dialogue with chatgpt. Remember to paste the source html into your notebook to record the dialogue. 

For each section, you only need to converse as long as it takes to get out a reasonable idea or two. Use the AI as a tool to help you brainstorm.

### What went well?
```
I am a high school student studying artificial intelligence, I'd like you to guide me on a semester-long reflection focused on developing a growth mindset and metacognition. Give responses that look like what a friendly, helpful, encouraging tutor would say. I know that you're not a real tutor, just an LLM.

First, I'd like to think about what went well this semester. Can you ask me just one question at a time to help reflect on this? 
```

### What didn't go well?

```
I am a high school student studying artificial intelligence, I'd like you to guide me on a semester-long reflection focused on developing a growth mindset and metacognition. Give responses that look like what a friendly, helpful, encouraging tutor would say. I know that you're not a real tutor, just an LLM.

Now, I'd like to think about any challenges I faced in the course. Can you guide me through a reflection on this topic by asking me one question at a time?
```

### Learning strategies
```
I am a high school student studying artificial intelligence, I'd like you to guide me on a semester-long reflection focused on developing a growth mindset and metacognition. Give responses that look like what a friendly, helpful, encouraging tutor would say. I know that you're not a real tutor, just an LLM.

Now, I'd like to think about the strategies I used to learn and understand the material in the course. Can you ask me questions about this *one a time* so we can think about ways I can improve as a learner?
```

### Course critique
```
I am a high school student studying artificial intelligence, I'd like you to guide me on a semester-long reflection focused on developing a growth mindset and metacognition. Give responses that look like what a friendly, helpful, encouraging tutor would say. I know that you're not a real tutor, just an LLM.

Now, I'd like to brainstorm feedback I can give to my instructor about the course. Can you help guide me in this brainstorming by asking me questions one at a time?
```

## Self-evaluation of learning

Now that we've reflected on the course itself, let's think about the material.





### Instructions
0. Copy-paste the following bulleted list into a text cell in nb2
1. For each bullet with a TODO, change the TODO to a rating 0-5 of how much you currently understand the topic
  2. For each bullet, use the below prompt (Prompt template), filling in the BLANK to dialogue with chatgpt to try to remind yourself about it/assess your understanding.

### Prompt template
```
I am a high school student studying artificial intelligence, I'd like you to guide me on a semester-long reflection focused on developing a growth mindset and metacognition. Give responses that look like what a friendly, helpful, encouraging tutor would say. I know that you're not a real tutor, just an LLM.

I'd like you to quiz me on a topic, one question at a time (without giving me the answer!) so I can assess my understanding. As I answer, please be sure to tell me if I said anything inaccurately or if there are big pieces I'm missing. I'd like to be quizzed on the topic of BLANK
